I created a game similar to the dinosaur game that plays when the internet goes off. In the game, you must click the space bar to jump over the moving snails. You can play the game as many times as you want! It's called the the astronaut

I wanted to make a fun game and was inspired by the dinosaur game!

I followed a tutorial on how to make a game in pygame.

I struggles on making the animations work and I learned how to use self in games!
